          <h2>here is <span class="girl"></span>'s mad, mad story</h2>
          <p>Once upon a time, there was a little girl named
          <span class="girl"></span> who had a crush on a little boy by the name of
          <span class="boy"></span>. They would often play outside with
          <span class="boy"></span>'s pet
          <span class="pet"></span> over behind the farm, near the lake, across from the cemetary. Every Saturday
          <span class="girl"></span> would make a picinic basket full of her favorite food, which was
          <span class="food_1"></span> mixed with ale and cider along with a side dish of
          <span class="food_2"></span> with mixed nuts and berries.
          <span class="girl"></span> and
          <span class="boy"></span> would then go with <span class="boy"></span>'s pet
          <span class="pet"></span> and hike through the cemetary. And every time they would come upon the big, scary
          <span class="monster"></span> who would demand their
          <span class="food_2"></span> in order to pass, otherwise, if they refused, he would banish them to
          <span class="country"></span> which was far, far away, where there was no
          <span class="food_1"></span> to be had. But, this last time, <span class="girl"></span> refused to give the ugly <span class="monster"></span> her dish of
          <span class="food_2"></span>, which resulted in...
